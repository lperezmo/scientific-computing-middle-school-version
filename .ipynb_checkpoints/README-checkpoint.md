A teaching module designed to introduce middle school students to the basics of Python programming. The larger goal of this repository is to encourage early exposure to Python programming among Middle School students, especially underrepresented minority communities in STEM and student's whose first language is not English.


## Contents

1. Project templates (main focus)
    These project templates will be given to students after the main material of the course is covered. I deeply believe students learn most by tinkering and altering code to do what they want. They main focus of this course will be to give students the opportunity to transform these templates into a personal project of their own making.
    
2. Course content
    Introductory presentation written with 'RISE', an open-source python API based on `reveal.js`. The presentation introduces programming to the students through the use of widgets.

Early exposure to programming can help address the existing gender gap in STEM-related field (1). It is also important to note that language might pose a hidden learning barrier for non-native English speakers (2).
